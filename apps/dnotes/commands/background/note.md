# background utilities and tasks

- cardinal rules: this is an "add-in": nothing in dnotes can depend on it, except for the bg tasks themselves
    - otherwise, too much complexity. make sure that there is no feature creep that some search depends on metadata generated by bg tasks
    - e.g. ns (note_search) cannot depend on some metadata generated by the background tasks

# TODO-As

- think
    - consolidate with apps/dtask_track (probably not)? Just think of final model, what is bg, what is other tracking apps, etc.
        - `bg` should be more about system wide maintenance, metadata verification, tracking to db than specific
