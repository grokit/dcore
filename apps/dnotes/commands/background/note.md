# background utilities and tasks

- cardinal rules: this is an "add-in": nothing in dnotes can depend on it, except for the bg tasks themselves
    - otherwise, too much complexity. make sure that there is no feature creep that some search depends on metadata generated by bg tasks
    - e.g. ns (note_search) cannot depend on some metadata generated by the background tasks
