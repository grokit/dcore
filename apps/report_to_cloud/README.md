# Report to Cloud

This is a script and webservice pair. For the machines on which the script run, it allows to pushish any information about the machine in a JSON format to the cloud. By default, it puslishes it's status (online / offline) as well as the subnet and public IP addresses every 30 seconds. 

# TODO

- Service that reflects public IP address to client (instead of using the stock one).
