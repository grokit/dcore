# Data System

System that eases taking and ordering notes.

## Features Wanted

### Public AND Private

Want github-style use to be able to modify whenever I think of an idea or I have free time.
However, some stuff is provate. How to work with that.

Within the public mode, automatic publish to a website.

### Easy Capture

Can either parse an external tool (such as google keep) or work on word documents or whatever.
The goal is to allow to quickly take notes with metadata, allows the system to swallow those notes

### Tag System

See mentioned in web/root.

### Reference and Save Refereed Work

- Any URL refered or reference used is parsed.

- Once parsed, another system gets a copy of the reference (.pdf or .html or whatever) and saves it in a data file.

The idea is to never be in a situation that you cannot find refered work because it has been 301'ed or censored. But at the same time it is painstaking and hard to keep track to have to manage manual copies.
