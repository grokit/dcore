# Shell Extentions

The scripts in this directory automatically generate shortcuts in Windows and Linux that invoke them from anywhere in a shell.

# Ideas

Maybe automatically name the shortcut the same as the file without the .py?
- Could have an option for an additional alias (creates two shortcuts)?


## Move to Known Place: mvt <place_name> file/folder

place_name is looked in the usual system_description.py

#
- Just use the name of the scripts for the command-line short-cut. Do not require meta flag if in this directory.

- Be able to list and edit any script:
    - dcripts edit <name>
    - dcripts list
