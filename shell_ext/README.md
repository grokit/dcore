# Shell Extentions

The scripts in this directory automatically generate shortcuts in Windows and Linux that invoke them from anywhere in a shell.

# Ideas

Maybe automatically name the shortcut the same as the file without the .py?
- Could have an option for an additional alias (creates two shortcuts)?


## Move to Known Place: mvt <place_name> file/folder

place_name is looked in the usual system_description.py
