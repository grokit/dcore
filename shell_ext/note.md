# on naming

Use generic / category to specific in left-to-right order.

For example, let's say there is a script for resizing pictures. There are the following options:

- a. resize_pictures
- b. picture_resize
- c. media_picture_resize

b. and c. are prefered. If you pick a., it makes it hard for the user to list (using autocomplete) all programs available.
With c., the user can enter `media_`, hit TAB and see the different related scripts. `resize_` is a less useful category.
