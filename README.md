## As

- python script to WIPE all lines which have `:::` in it. option to do until next ';'. 

## Bs
## Cs

ns / dcore: FIRST: stable sort!!!!
tag:::now for anote.md in root folder does not work

hs -o <name>
--> look for any file in history which starts with vi or vim then filename that exist, prompt if more than one and open in vi

- gen-scripts : does not detect if duplicate.
- merge data and options, options -> also root directory to use

respect :::important flag in ordering

!!!
ff -o broken-path --> open in vim
bring a selector if more than one
!!!!!

ns:
use a stable sort (2nd criteria: lexico)

install:
    Magic dcore tag: 0jb02xhs83hayd9fugb7wu2as3q419ki_BEGIN
    ^^ move this to same as bashrc changes

add:
export VISUAL=vim
export EDITOR="$VISUAL"

remove youtube-dl from bashrc

Ns:
    Now: look for tag,not uuid
    Default search should be 1 line per hit. Use -c if want context.
    !!!!!! merge (file.md,   <query-that-matches-unique>)

search history: hs

clippad:
    save stdout to a file with date or to a large file

savelast:
    save last command to clippad
runlast:
    enumerate last 15, number runs command again

hs:
    hs <regex> should filter
bug where L instead of lines => no filter
filter in wrong order

lrun -c : copy to clipboard
    -- default to last one

ff:
support WHATEV <space>/path

add cls

Ns:
    !!!! all folder in: AS TAG!


## tool idea: nice rename

build: nice rename:

rename textual without any regex or shell happening (raw)
can do more complicated back-substitution
by default takes all files, but can filter
rename files as well if they match
