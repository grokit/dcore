# DCORE

This is a collection of Python scripts, which provide miscellaneous utilities such as:
- Setup Linux box by installing all dependencies.
- Send email from command line.
- Full fledged note-taking program.
- Auto-shortcuts to move around directories on command-line.
- Task-tracking and plotting of objectives.
- Stores db of all files, allow quick searching and opening.
- Resize pictures.
- Quick compile and run of C++ single-application files.
- Quick backups.
- Rename files and file content.
- ...

I use github to sync between machines, and I don't mind if other people use or derive from my stuff in here.
However, be aware that I make breaking changes all the time, so if you plan to use it better fork your own version.
