# TODO

## As

- python script to WIPE all lines which have `:::` in it. option to do until next ';'. 

## Bs
## Cs

insert time when filing, not as typing (since nothing stays in ingest for too long)
insert it after the first pound OR at complete beginning

ns / dcore: FIRST: stable sort!!!!
tag:::now for anote.md in root folder does not work

hs -o <name>
--> look for any file in history which starts with vi or vim then filename that exist, prompt if more than one and open in vi

- gen-scripts : does not detect if duplicate.
- merge data and options, options -> also root directory to use

respect :::important flag in ordering

ff -o broken-path --> open in vim
bring a selector if more than one

ns:
use a stable sort (2nd criteria: lexico)

install:
    Magic dcore tag: 0jb02xhs83hayd9fugb7wu2as3q419ki_BEGIN
    ^^ move this to same as bashrc changes

add:
export VISUAL=vim
export EDITOR="$VISUAL"

remove youtube-dl from bashrc

Ns:
    Now: look for tag,not uuid
    Default search should be 1 line per hit. Use -c if want context.
    !!!!!! merge (file.md,   <query-that-matches-unique>)

search history: hs

clippad:
    save stdout to a file with date or to a large file

savelast:
    save last command to clippad
runlast:
    enumerate last 15, number runs command again

hs:
    hs <regex> should filter
bug where L instead of lines => no filter
filter in wrong order

lrun -c : copy to clipboard
    -- default to last one

ff:
support WHATEV <space>/path

add cls

Ns:
    !!!! all folder in: AS TAG!


## tool idea: nice rename

build: nice rename:

rename textual without any regex or shell happening (raw)
can do more complicated back-substitution
by default takes all files, but can filter
rename files as well if they match


# Future Projects Idea

## Web Store


project: webapi swallow (chomp?)

saves to json with type and time
has option to send email copy
has sync program so that all nodes find each other and sync
can list from most recent to oldest
can apply transform (plot, etc) defined as custom .js programs
confirm wrote (and number of copies), or send exception
every data has author (anonymous included, optional sign with pri/pub keys)

==> make it so flexible it can be used as a chat platform
