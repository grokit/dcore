# DCore: What is it

The 'DCore' lib has two purposes:
    1. Place to put scripts that the main applications I develop can depend on and share (a core lib of some sort).
    2. Neat collection of scrits that make the computer a better development platform that I install on everyone of my computers.

This is shared on github, so put all personal information elsewhere :P.
